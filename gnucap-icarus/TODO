Gnucap-Icarus cosimulation plugin
ToDo list:


1. Get rid of method EVAL_BM_EXTPWL::voltage()
instead of using this method, gnucap measurement shall be used (as far as  
understanded now). Consequently - remove all what si related to ::voltage().

2. Make EVAL_BM_EXTPWL derived from EVAL_BM_PWL

3. make more usage examples

4. Minor fixes:
  o Move to gnucap-2009-10-11
  o complete GNU BUILD (.so lib is not build yet using GNU Build system)
  + fix KevinC's changes in Makefiles

5. Icarus/Verilog is modified. 
   Make that changes "movable" to icarus/verilog upstream 


6. Here are Al Davis' comments on plugin and related changes in gnucap.
Code has to be fixed accordingly


> I am assuming that this is intended as a temporary hack to get

> am further assuming that everyone involved knows this, and is 
> not surprised that I am saying so here.

> It is my policy that the core must not have hooks for specific 
> plugins, even if they are static linked.  Any place where there 
> is such a hook now, that is considered to be a release-critical 
> bug, and "encapsulation violation".

> There is a similar policy regarding functions marked as 
> "obsolete", especially those with "obsolete_callback" in the 
> name.  It is likely that I will let these go for now, but they 
> will be removed as soon as it is practical to do so.  Based on 
> this code being temporary, don't worry about it, but in the long 
> run, anything using obsolete_callback will need to be changed.

> There is a new snapshot coming out VERY SOON.  There are 
> significant changes to the plugin interface, so some changes 
> will be required to accomodate this.  The changes are not 
> apparent to the user, but mostly have to do with fixing 
> "encapsulation violations", so there can be a clean separation 
> between "library" and "applications".  Most changes are in the 
> s_* hierarchy, which is considered private in the sense that 
> nothing outside of the s_* hierarchy is allowed to access it 
> directly.  Any old code that references any data through SIM:: 
> will need to be changed.  There will be other benefits of this 
> in the long run, but it means some changes are needed now.

> Now that I got that out of the way ..

> None of the changes in gnucap-icarus.diff are necessary.

> e_elemnt.h: node() .. please use n_().  It does what you want. 
> On a closer look at the code, better yet .. don't use it at all.  
> You use it in "voltage".  Just use "tr_outvolts()" instead.  The

 a) get rid from "voltage" and node() 

> to_string(long) .. I don't see why you need it.  Please explain.  
> Is it left over from old stuff?  I'm not opposed to it if you 
> really need it, but don't want to have extra stuff that is not 
> used or tested.  It is likely that if it were included, that it 
> would get purged in a Muntzing.

b) decide about to_string(long)

> s_tr.h virtuals.  ..  This is in the s_* hierarchy, and 
> considered to be part of the transient plugin.  In the version 
> with separate library and applications, it won't be available 
> across plugins.  Instead of doing this, can you do what you need 
> in the "precalc", "expand" and "tr_advance" functions, as part 
> of the bm_extpwl.h ?

c) move needed operations to precalc, expand, tr_advance

> u_parameter.h: get_str() .. why not just use Get?

d) use Get, get rid from get_str()  

results:
DONE a) get rid from "voltage" and node()       ( tr_outvolts() used )
DONE b) decide about to_string(long)            ( removed )
     c) move needed operations to precalc, 
        expand, tr_advance
DONE d) use Get, get rid from get_str()         (Getptr moved in plugin)
