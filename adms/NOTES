This adms-script generate (analog) gnucap-models from verilog

To use:
	- configure gnucap with --enable-adms
	- admsXml(v2.3.0) must be installed
	$ $EDITOR dev.va
	$ gnucap-adms dev.va
	$ gcc -fPIC $(gnucap-conf --cppflags) --shared dev.cc -o dev.so
	gnucap> load dev.so

Folowing models are built-in in gnucap (with --enable-adms):
	d_hicum0.va	hicum0
	d_ota_simpl.va	ota_simpl
	d_ctest.va	ctest
	d_rtest.va 	rtest
	d_dtest.va 	dtest
	d_opamp.va	opamp

Adms 2.3.0 can be downloaded from:
http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/sfnet_mot-adms/downloads/adms-source/2.3/adms-2.3.0.tar.gz/

The script gnucap.xml.in will be modified, before can be used by admsXml:
a) convert_symb: replaces all xml-special-character on all lines that not begins with "<"
Reason: it allows to write readable c++ code outside of xml-tags. The only xml-special-character you must take care of are: "$" (can be generated by "\$") and "%" (can be generated by "%%", for example: print("%%d\n", 10); )

b) split.py: split gnucap.xml in many files, for each scope in gnucap.xml respectively
Reason: many script-files allow you to implement something like derivation, for example:
	admsXml -e sript1.xml -e script2.xml -e script3.xml

	script1:
		template a calls b
		template b
	script2:
		calls a (-> calls script1::b)
	script3:
		template b
		calls a (-> calls script3::b)

If you try to impement this example with scopes, the script2-"a"-call will use script3::b (looks like a bug).
